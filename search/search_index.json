By adhering to widely accepted standards, iHRIS aims to enhance data exchange, improve interoperability, and facilitate the efficient use of human resource information in the healthcare domain.</p> <p>Prior to 2019: Older versions of iHRIS (4.x ) have always supported interoperability through custom data mapping modules. These modules mapped SQL data to different international standards like Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), Care Services Discovery (CSD) and Sharing Value Sets (SVS).</p> <p>Current State Assessment: From mid-2019, a massive upgrade was undertaken to modernize iHRIS. This included designing a whole new interface, improving reporting and dashboards, and using newer underline technologies like NodeJS, VueJS.</p> <p>The most significant upgrade was to make iHRIS Natively FHIR Compliant. As such, every element of iHRIS is based on FHIR, from defining system configurations to data structures and even how the front end is designed and rendered.</p> <p></p> <p>Data Exchange Standards Supported by iHRIS:</p> <p>As stated above, iHRIS is Natively FHIR Complaint. As such iHRIS implements the HL7 FHIR standard for exchanging HR-related data, such as employee demographics, qualifications, job roles, training and any other data one would want to collect on health workers. FHIR enables seamless integration and data exchange with other health information systems within the OpenHIE framework.</p> <p>iHRIS exposes the FHIR API that allows iHRIS to publish and consume health worker data with other FHIR-compliant systems like GOFR, OpenMRS, and DHIS2 to mention but a few.</p> <p>iHRIS can also exchange data with both FHIR-compliant and non-FHIR-compliant systems through the OpenHIE Interoperability layer, using tools like OpenHIM and OpenFn. This layer enables seamless communication and interoperability across various health information systems within the OpenHIE ecosystem.</p> <p>What next: From late 2023 to 2024, iHRIS development team will be working to implement the necessary features and functionality to support adding the Aggregate data exchange (ADX) standard. Currently iHRIS can send individual data (e.g. health worker job title), this addition will enable iHRIS to share aggregate data (e.g. number of nurses in a facility) with systems like DHIS2, to link HR data with service delivery data.</p> <p>Conclusion: The interoperability roadmap for iHRIS outlines the data exchange standards supported by iHRIS, mainly HL7 FHIR. Additionally, it highlights the planned data exchange initiatives with other OpenHIE architectural components such as the Facility Registry, Terminology Service, Client Registry, Health Workforce Management, and Interoperability Layer. By adhering to these standards and collaborating with other OpenHIE components, iHRIS aims to promote interoperability, enhance data exchange, and contribute to efficient health workforce management and planning.</p>"},{"location":"dev/page/","title":"Creating data display page","text":""},{"location":"dev/page/#creating-data-display-page","title":"Creating data display page","text":"<p>Pages define how a resource is displayed by default and how it is edited.

In most cases for iHRiS we use #active</li> <li>date - This is the date the questionnaire was created</li> <li>item - This is where data fields and data fields grouping is happening. item is an indexed array to allow you to define multiple fields and multiple sections of fields. item has elements to help in defining your field or section as explained below:</li> <li>linkId - this is unique id for the field in the questionnaire. For iHRIS, field path within the resource becomes a linkId i.e for birthDate of a practitioner, the linkId becomes Practitioner.birthDate. For array fields, the linkId will be an array as well i.e if we are defining a field for Practitioner surname, the linkId becomes Practitioner.name[0].family. It is very crucial to properly define linkId as it is used in converting the questionnaire into respective resources the questionnaire is collecting data for.</li> <li>definition - This is where definition of your field can be found, and fields are defined in fhir profiles. Definition starts with the profile url and ends with the field path. So if you have a Practitioner profile with a url http://ihris.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ihris-practitioner and the field you are defining on the questionnaire is Practitioner family name, then the definition will be http://ihris.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ihris-practitioner#Practitioner.name.family. Note that profile url and field path are separated by #.</li> <li>text - This is the display text for the section or a field.</li> <li>type - This is the type of an item. If the item is a section or grouping of fields then the type is group, otherwise the type will depend on the field data type. If the field is of type string then the type becomes #string, if the field is a Coding or Code then the type becomes choice. refer to Questionnaire data types in here</li> <li>required - Tells if an item is required or not. If an item is marked as required = true then iHRIS will add validation rules to ensure the field or section has values.</li> <li>repeats - This is when you want to collect more that one value for a field or you want a section to be repeated for multiple responses of section fields. It applies array fields/sections.</li> <li> <p>readOnly - set this to true if you need a field to be read only. readOnly fields won't be displayed. If needed to display, use a display questionnaire item</p> </li> <li> <p>answerOption - This is used to set allowed value for the field, and it is normally used with readOnly since readOnly fields are hidden or cant be modified then you use answerOption to set their values.

It is used to define choice list to be used. The value is a url to the valueSet that has choice list. If the field is marital status and you have a value set of marital status with id marital-status-valueset then the value for answerValueSet will be http://ihris.org/fhir/ValueSet/marital-status-valueset.

Note: there are two tables of contacts - one within the mHero module, used for selecting contacts to send messages/flows to; and one within the People module, used for viewing records in the system.</p> <p>The table of contacts contains records for all health workers who have records in iHRIS, RapidPro, or mHero (or other connected registry). Each row contains information for one health worker. By default you will see 10 rows of results per page. In the bottom right corner of the table you will see some information about the results that are displayed. It tells you the number of rows being displayed per page followed by which results within the full set that are displayed (for example, \"1-10 of 68\" means the first 10 results within the set of 68 are being displayed).</p> <p>You can use the backward and forward pointing arrows to navigate through the pages of records.</p> <p>You can change the number of records displayed per page in the table by clicking the drop down menu next to \"Rows per page\" at the bottom right corner of the table. You can choose to display 5, 10, 20, or 50 records. The table will update once you have made your selection. Note: if there are more than 10,000 health worker records you will not have the option to display all on the same page due to the time it would take to pull up all of that data and browser capacity. You will have to select the option to see 10,000 records per page and view or select records in batches of 10,000.</p> <p>To search by name type all or part of their given name or surname in the space that looks like a tab and is labeled \"Fullname\". This is next to the table title (\"Employee List\"). You can search by a partial name and will see results that contain those letters. You must hit Enter or Return in order to run the search. If you wish to remove the name search filter, delete what you have typed and hit Enter or Return again.</p> <p>To search/filter by other fields (contact group/facility/job title/cadre) you click on the word in the field you wish to search. You can either type in a search word or scroll through the list to select a filter. To search, start typing what you want to search for and the list of options for that field will automatically filter to display matches; you can then select which match(es) you wish to use to filter the table. Alternatively you can scroll through the list to select the groups/facilities/job titles/cadres you wish to apply as filters. You can apply more than one filter including across more than one record field/column (i.e. two different groups or one facility plus one cadre).</p> <p>To remove or clear a filter you can either click on the X that is at the end of the field \"tab\" and that will clear all of the filters, or to clear a single filter at a time you can click on the search/filter term and touch the \"Delete\" key on your keyboard.</p> <p>Add a contact If the iHRIS instance has not been updated to v5, adding contact records should be done in the iHRIS instance that is already in use, not in the iHRIS v5 shell. Contacts created in iHRIS v5 shell will not be synced to the primary iHRIS instance.</p> <p>Adding a contact in the iHRIS v5 shell where the mHero module is found will create a contact that can be sent a message/flow via mHero, but it will not add the contact to the main iHRIS instance. For this reason the data fields in the contact record are not the complete set that exist in iHRIS. To illustrate, you will be able to enter information such as name, contact details, job title, etc., but you will not be able to enter information such as from which institution the health worker received their degree, previous job positions, trainings they participated in, languages they speak, etc.</p> <ol> <li> <p>To add a new contact to your mHero instance, click on \"Add Person\" either in the dashboard on the home page or in the left side navigation bar.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enter the information about the contact to the form. You can include identifiers and basic demographic information, contact information and also information about the health worker's position.

In that case, you can scroll down the page to see the uncompleted required fields highlighted with a red frame.</p> <p>Add multiple contacts (bulk upload) If the iHRIS instance has not been updated to v5, adding contact records should be done in the iHRIS instance that is already in use, not in the iHRIS v5 shell. Contacts created in iHRIS v5 shell will not be synced to the primary iHRIS instance.</p> <p>Modify contact information If the iHRIS instance has not been updated to v5, modifying contact records should be done in the iHRIS instance that is already in use, not in the iHRIS v5 shell. Contacts modified in the iHRIS v5 shell will not be synced to the primary iHRIS instance.</p> <p>The only existing contacts that you will be able to modify are those that are stored in the iHRIS v5 shell. To modify contacts stored in the main iHRIS instance you must do so within the main iHRIS instance.</p> <ol> <li> <p>To modify the record of an existing contact, click on \"Search People\" either in the dashboard on the home page or in the left side navigation bar.</p> </li> <li> <p>Locate the contact whose record you want to modify. You can do this by scrolling down through the table of contacts (including increasing the number of rows displayed per page) and by searching or applying filters. You can find guidance related to viewing and searching contacts here.</p> </li> </ol> <p>When you have identified the contact whose record you want to modify, select it by clicking anywhere in the row in the table of contacts.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The next page will display the fields included in each contact record and any associated information saved to that record. To edit any of the record fields click on the \"EDIT\" button at the top right corner of the page.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can then modify any of the information saved to the contact record or you can add information where information has not previously been added.

It uses data from existing local health information systems to deliver messages via locally popular communication channels. It reduces the barriers that can exist between health workers and their support systems, playing a critical role in ensuring effective and efficient responses, particularly in a crisis.</p> <p>Health officials can use mHero to:</p> <ol> <li>Communicate both routine and urgent messages to health workers.</li> <li>Target messages to health workers based on cadre, location, or skill set.</li> <li>Collect critical information that powers resilient health systems, including stock levels, routine and one-time assessments, and validation of health worker and facility data.</li> <li>Build capacity and provide support to health workers, to give them the information, skills, and encouragement to deliver quality health services.</li> </ol> <p>mHero is not a new technology. Instead, it is a new way to connect data from existing technologies to allow for targeted, real-time communication. It does so by using global interoperability standards for health information exchange (FHIR). In other words, mHero can help platforms speak in a common language and easily share data.</p> <p>IntraHealth International and UNICEF created mHero in August 2014 to support health-sector communication during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia. The original version of mHero connected Liberia's health workforce information system, iHRIS, with RapidPro, a platform that delivers basic text and audio messages. The use of RapidPro made it possible to reach most Liberian frontline health workers using only basic mobile phones.</p> <p>Since the end of the Ebola crisis, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Liberia has integrated the platform into its health information system infrastructure to meet ongoing communication needs for various health services. Several other countries have also tested or deployed mHero.</p> <p>The technology behind mHero has also evolved since the initial deployment in Liberia. Both advancements in technology, as well as varying conditions and needs in other countries, inspired IntraHealth to make mHero more interoperable. It can operate with other communication platforms and any health information systems compliant with the global Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards.

Information from health worker records is sourced from iHRIS, including: phone or other contact details, names, cadres, facility names, locations. This information is used to contact health workers, both broadly and targeted. Message flows or message campaigns created in RapidPro are pulled into the mHero module which also uses the communication channels set up there to send out messages.</p> <p>The architecture is flexible to connect different platforms and channels on both ends. Using FHIR standards makes it possible to connect any health information software that also uses FHIR, such as DHIS2, OpenMRS, and more. One possible use case with another software connected is pulling client phone numbers from OpenMRS to send reminders about upcoming appointments.</p> <p>While mHero has to-date only delivered text-based messages via SMS, there are many communications channels that can be utilized to connect with health workers via locally popular channels. Through Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp it would be possible to send and receive multimedia content. mHero can also be connected with a traditional call center, where curated messages can enable trained staff to respond with speed and effectiveness. Finally, it is possible to incorporate natural language processing, permitting frontline health workers to ask questions using normal speech and the system can respond with the appropriate government-approved messages.</p>"},{"location":"user/people/","title":"People","text":""},{"location":"user/people/#people","title":"People","text":""},{"location":"user/people/#health-worker-information","title":"Health Worker Information","text":"<p>Health workers details are managed in the  module \u201cPEOPLE\u201d; which includes the option to add health workers and search health worker records in the system.
